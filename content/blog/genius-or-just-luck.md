There are more examples but one of the best names in 'Of Mice and Men' is the name of a town near the ranch where the novella takes place.

Soledad is a town where some of the workers go to spend their money on alcohol, gambling, and prostitution.

I'm not the first to notice that Soledad is the Spanish word for solitude. Isolated men frequent a town named solitude. Surely

However, in 'East of Eden' - a novel written by Steinbeck 15 years after 'Of Mice and Men' was published - Steinbeck explains something of Soledad's history which is not brought to our attention as often.

In 'East of Eden', the narrator notes that the Spaniards, because they were 'religious people', travelled with priests and because priests could read and write it was Spanish priests who kept records, drew maps, and often named the places the Spaniards colonized.

According to the narrator, places were often named after 'saints' names or religious holidays' and the narrator posits that 'Soledad' falls into the latter category.

Indeed, Mary, mother of Jesus, is known as María de la Soledad (Our Lady of Solitude) and so 'Soledad' could refer to the celebration of María de la Soledad's feast day on December 18th.

However, we now know that the town of Soledad was named after Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad.

A mission is an organised effort to evangelize a faith and so in this context 'Mission' refers to a building or group of buildings used by a mission.

This particular Spanish Catholic mission was named after Mary, Nuestra Señora de la Soledad (Our Lady of Solitude).
