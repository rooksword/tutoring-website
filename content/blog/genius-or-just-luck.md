# Introduction

Coincidence makes for unsteady ground in literary analysis. It is rare that a writer gives any explicit indication as to their intention. The older the text you are studying, the less likely it is that records of the author's personal thoughts exist at all.

The most famous celebrated writer who we know little about is Shakespeare. So when we encounter something remarkable yet unlikely in his works, we have very little to rely on to prove or disprove whether it was an act of genius or just luck.

My favourite example of literary analysis which is tantalisingly tenuous comes from Shakespeare's Sonnet 73. The third line reads

> Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,

(for context, a bough is a branch)

One contributor on [Genius](https://genius.com/1703201?) (which I admit is an unreliable if accessible source of literary analysis) writes

> Note the clever word-play. A bare bough may be thought of as spear-like in appearance. It is described as shaking against the cold. So this could be a secret reference to Shakespeare himself.

On one hand, this seems silly. A bough is a branch which is a pointy stick which could look like a spear which combined with the word 'shake' could form the name Shakespeare.

On the other hand, Shakespeare is known to have made thousands of puns in his texts.

For example, Sonnet 136 ends with the following couplet which seemingly references the poet's name

> Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
> 
> And then thou lovest me, for my name is Will.

If a pun is nothing more than effective use of a word or phrase which suggests multiple meanings, then I argue the pun is created as much by the reader's personal interpretation as it is by the writer's intention.

The very notion of the "accidental pun" tells us that a pun can be created without any participation from the words' creator.

# Hidden Meaning in *Of Mice and Men*

There are more examples but one of the best names in 'Of Mice and Men' is the name of a town near the ranch where the novella takes place.

Soledad is a town where some of the workers go to spend their money on alcohol, gambling, and prostitution.

> the guys went into Soledad and raised hell

I'm not the first to notice that Soledad is the Spanish word for solitude. Isolated men frequent a town named solitude. Surely

However, in 'East of Eden' - a novel written by Steinbeck 15 years after 'Of Mice and Men' was published - Steinbeck explains something of Soledad's history which is not brought to our attention as often.

In 'East of Eden', the narrator notes that the Spaniards, because they were 'religious people', travelled with priests and because priests could read and write it was Spanish priests who kept records, drew maps, and often named the places the Spaniards colonized.

According to the narrator, places were often named after 'saints' names or religious holidays' and the narrator posits that 'Soledad' falls into the latter category.

Indeed, Mary, mother of Jesus, is known as María de la Soledad (Our Lady of Solitude) and so 'Soledad' could refer to the celebration of María de la Soledad's feast day on December 18th.

However, we now know that the town of Soledad was named after Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad.

A mission is an organised effort to evangelize a faith and so in this context 'Mission' refers to a building or group of buildings used by a mission.

This particular Spanish Catholic mission was named after Mary, Nuestra Señora de la Soledad (Our Lady of Solitude).
